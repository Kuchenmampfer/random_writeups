## Single Player or Teams
I think the most important question is whether we want a single player turnament or a team turnament.
So lets have a quick overview over the pros and cons:

### Arguments pro Single Player
- less coordination needed
- simpler turney structure
- everyone can participate
- not many players needed for a turney
- easy to have the whole turney on one day
- we get to see who is the best

### Arguments pro Teams
- more interaction between players
- bigger hype potential
- turney can handle many players
- CR and GBBL have shown that these are more exciting
- Many possibilities for different modes
- Well suited for a turney taking place over several days/weeks
- winner less predictable

I personally would prefer a team turnament if we get enough participants.
Around 8 Teams is where it starts to get nice I guess. At least that is the size of the GBBL and I quite enjoyed it.
However, maybe having the first turnament as single player is a good idea since that is not as big and we would have the chance to see how many players are interested, how the organisation can be optimized etc.


## Modes
* [KO](#ko)
* [Double Elimination](#double-elimination)
* [Swiss](#swiss)
* [League](#league)
* [Mixed](#mixed)

### KO
- Pros
  - simple and easy to understand
  - can handle a huge amount of players/teams
  - exciting finale
  - not many matches needed to decide a winner
- Cons
  - one strong opponent can throw you out of the turney -> much luck
  - frustrating to half the players to only play one game
### Double Elimination
- Pros
  - can handle many teams/players
  - exciting finale
  - everyone gets a second chance -> much less luck than KO
  - a little complicated, but many players are familiar with this I guess
- Cons
  - still most players are thrown out of the turney quite early
  - needs much more matches than KO to decide a winner
### Swiss
- Pros
  - every player can play the whole turnament against fair opponents
  - very little luck involved
  - I really enjoyed this mode in chess turnaments
  - It was a partial succes in the Sofajäger Solo Cup
  - very flexible in the number of rounds to play
  - can handle a huge amount of players/teams
- Cons
  - Nobody knows this mode -> hard to understand
  - no exciting finale
  - can get boring when the ranking is settled after ~ 8 rounds
### League
- Pros
  - every player can play the whole turnament against fair opponents
  - extremely little luck involved
  - everyone knows this -> easy to understand
- Cons
  - needs a huge amount of matches, so maybe only suited for team turneys or a long term league (system)
### Mixed
This is the way to go I think. We can start with a less-lucky mode where every participant gets to play more than two games to decide the top four.
And then have a KO finale to make it exciting for everyone.
In a single player turney, swiss is the way to go for the first phase as a league can not handle that many players.
But in a turney with eight teams or so, league is probably better since everyone knows it and it's really fair. Also, this was the GBBL mode and I quite liked it.
The first phase could be held in parallel with an optional stream just popping into some games as it comes.
The KO finale would of course be streamed one match after the other.

## Matches
In a single player tournament, there are basically three options to decide a match:
- BO1 -> very fast but very luck based
- BO3 -> good balance between luck and time
- BO5 -> quite fair, but it takes a lot of time. Probably suited for (semi-)final
In a team turnament, there basically is one layer more. Direct duels can be fought in one of the three described ways.
However, a match can consist of multiple duels in many interesting ways:
- everyone against everyone -> very fair but needs a lot of time. Probably suited for a multiple weeks turney with one match a day. This was the mode of the last GBBL.
- every team numbers their players and the same numbers have a duel each -> much quicker. I enjoyed this mode in chess turneys
- king of the hill -> interesting mode that I am not sure about how to implement. However, I enjoyed it in the CRL

## Streaming
Noc can stream with live commentary on yt. Probably best with two accounts so you can view both attacks in parallel or switch between them. If we want to get SC to advertise the tourney, they will probably want that stream so they ca post it afterwards. Then it will be important that it contains no visible emulator as the do not like/allow them.

## Additional Thoughts
- Price: A price is a nice to have, but the right advertisement, strong participants, good organisation and a great stream is more important.
- possible prices: gold pass, nitro, money, role
- one day turney/multi day turney: Huge difference in organization effort, depends on the mode. One day is probably best on weekend.
- having a long term league would suit the server name
- crazy idea: Have a new account push competition where everyone creates a new account and starts constructing builder base at the same time and one month later, the winner is the one with the highest PB. No gemming and no power potions allowed. Progress could be tracked with my bot.
- After the previous event, many people would have ~bh 5 accounts, so we could do small builder hall turneys

## Banning Troups
Here we have some different positions:
- üüüüüüüüüü: "This is a bad idea because it is too powerfull. You do not have 103 alternatives like you do in CR."
- Kelo: "banning troops is imo doable but i wouldn't recommend it for first tourneys something we could consider later down the road."
- Heron: "Instead of banning a single troop which realistically wipes out numerous strats (plus an entire team if focused on their best players) .... Why not do what SC did with YT tourney (BH6/7) whereby players had to change at least 1 troop from their previous game, thereby encouraging use of multiple strats..." 

## Recap of the Sofajäger Cup
(submitted by (Un)lucky)
1. We used Discord for registration. 
2. I used challonge.com to create a tournament tree
2. We used double elimination which means you can lose once and still win (edit: This is true for the first two cups. The third one was swiss and everyone liked it except for the lack of an exciting finale. So we planned the next one to be mixed swiss plus KO, but it never happened.)
3. I added all the names of the players, most of the time without any seeding but you could sort them that the highest personalbest or last seasonfinish plays against the lowest in the first round but that only adds frustration for the lower experience players. 
4. We created a clan in which the matches will be played. We always had  at least 3 Accounts from Organisation and Streamer in the clan. 
-2 for the Streamer to switch between both attacks or have them splitscreen5
-1 for me which announced the matches to be played in chat. 
More Organisationaccounts simplifirs the process as it is really stressful at times. 
5. I always put the Results on challonge.com which filled the tournament tree and gave me the new matches and some interesting stats if you enter the Stars and Percentage as well. 
6. Because we had multiple matches at the same time we had the rule to keep the chat cleared, which made it the announcements of the matches easier to see and to make it easier to See the results especially when it is in a bo3. 
To speed up the process we had Bo1 for the first round and bo3 for later rounds with a bo5 final. 
If you have any more questions or want to organize one I am glad to help you. If you want I can send you our English Version of the rule book as well.
(edit: Here we have the rulebook of the latest planned tourney that did not take place due to the lack of participants: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7Wv_yK_6DnR-QUvA5a0CXlhmLdUtmI6_-KAUOjI0kk/edit)
