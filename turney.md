## Single Player/Teams
I think the most important question is whether we want a single player turnament or a team turnament.
So lets have a quick overview over the pros and cons:

### Arguments pro Single Player
- less coordination needed
- simpler turney structure
- everyone can participate
- not many players needed for a turney
- easy to have the whole turney on one day
- we get to see who is the best

### Arguments pro Teams
- more interaction between players
- bigger hype potential
- turney can handle many players
- CR and GBBL have shown that these are more exciting
- Many possibilities for different modes
- Well suited for a turney taking place over several days/weeks
- winner less predictable

I personally would prefer a team turnament if we get enough participants.
Around 8 Teams is where it starts to get nice I guess. At least that is the size of the GBBL and I quite enjoyed it.


## Modes
* [KO](#ko)
* [Double Elimination](#double-elimination)
* [Swiss](#swiss)
* [League](#league)
* [Mixed](#mixed)

### KO
- Pros
  - simple and easy to understand
  - can handle a huge amount of players/teams
  - exciting finale
  - not many matches needed to decide a winner
- Cons
  - one strong opponent can throw you out of the turney -> much luck
  - frustrating to half the players to only play one game
### Double Elimination
- Pros
  - can handle many teams/players
  - exciting finale
  - everyone gets a second chance -> much less luck than KO
  - a little complicated, but many players are familiar with this I guess
- Cons
  - still most players are thrown out of the turney quite early
  - needs much more matches than KO to decide a winner
### Swiss
- Pros
  - every player can play the whole turnament against fair opponents
  - very little luck involved
  - I really enjoyed this mode in chess turnaments
  - It was a partial succes in the SofajÃ¤ger Solo Cup
  - very flexible in the number of rounds to play
  - can handle a huge amount of players/teams
- Cons
  - Nobody knows this mode -> hard to understand
  - no exciting finale
  - can get boring when the ranking is settled after ~ 8 rounds
### League
- Pros
  - every player can play the whole turnament against fair opponents
  - extremely little luck involved
  - everyone knows this -> easy to understand
- Cons
  - needs a huge amount of matches, so maybe only suited for team turneys or a long term league (system)
### Mixed
This is the way to go I think. We can start with a less-lucky mode where every participant gets to play more than two games to decide the top four.
And then have a KO finale to make it exciting for everyone.
In a single player turney, swiss is the way to go for the first phase as a league can not handle that many players.
But in a turney with eight teams or so, league is probably better since everyone knows it and it's really fair. Also, this was the GBBL mode and I quite liked it.
The first phase could be held in parallel with an optional stream just popping into some games as it comes.
The KO finale would of course be streamed one match after the other.

## Matches
In a single player tournament, there are basically three options to decide a match:
- BO1 -> very fast but very luck based
- BO3 -> good balance between luck and time
- BO5 -> quite fair, but it takes a lot of time. Probably suited for (semi-)final
In a team turnament, there basically is one layer more. Direct duels can be fought in one of the three described ways.
However, a match can consist of multiple duels in many interesting ways:
- everyone against everyone -> very fair but needs a lot of time. Probably suited for a multiple weeks turney with one match a day. This was the mode of the last GBBL.
- every team numbers their players and the same numbers have a duel each -> much quicker. I enjoyed this mode in chess turneys
- king of the hill -> interesting mode that I am not sure about how to implement. However, I enjoyed it in the CRL

## Additional Thoughts
- Price: A price is a nice to have, but the right advertisement, strong participants, good organisation and a great stream is more important.
- possible prices: gold pass, nitro, money, role
- banning troups: This is a bad idea because it is too powerfull. You do not have 103 alternatives like you do in CR.
- one day turney/multi day turney: Huge difference in organization effort, depends on the mode. One day is probably best on weekend.
