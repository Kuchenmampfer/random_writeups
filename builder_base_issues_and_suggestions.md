# Currently, I see the following problems in builder base:
## #1 The meta never changes
   This is caused by the severe lack of updates and new content. It is easy to fix by frequent (every three months) balance changes plus new content on a regular basis.

## #2 1v1 sucks when you play against overlevelled opponents
   It is important to not that this problem only really applies to mid ladder (2k - 5k) as below that, progress is so fast that you don't really notice. And above that, everyone is maxed and the 1v1 aspect actually is one of the best things about builder base.

## #3 There is a hard limit in how much you can farm per day
   This is chill, but for many people, this kills their motivation. It could be met by giving loot for every attack, but decrease a loot multiplier to conserve some of the daily aspect

## #4 bb is only ladder and that is not for everyone
   Just create more competing arenas. Something for low level players, something for clans, an official world cup tournament with media coverage, etc.

## #5 A clan aspect is missing
   There are many possibilities. Clan wars, clan tournaments, clan leagues, a cooperative exploration of some night/shadow world etc. Working on this would also partly fix problems 1. and 4.

## #6 Too many buildings/too much spam
   You could decrease the number of buildings and troups. This would also allow for a very interesting idea to approach problem #9. Besides that, you can also make sure that every troup and every defence has a clear weakness/counter, so combining the strenghts of different components stays required.

## #7 Time tiebreak makes no sense
   It does make sense in mid ladder as a weak try to fix problem #8, but not at top ladder because it favoures spam and the more skill an attack requires, the longer it usually takes. So I would suggest to just get rid of the tiebreak above 5k

## #8 waiting for the opponent can be annoying
   Top ladder should not complain here because they spend hours battling anyways and the small inconvenience is easily outweighed by the charme of 1v1. Of course you can try to make strats like archers quicker, but overall, they just have to deal with playing on a high level to be time consuming. For low and midladder though, this definitely is a problem and I think getting rid of 1v1 below 5k is a valid approach to this.

## #9 Base building does not really matter
   Nearly everyone just copies bases because that is extremely easy and once people get so high that it matters if a base is known, their attacks are already so much better than their bases that it is a real pain to start with base building.
   This could be met at top level with adding maybe ten minutes to build a base for every single match. This is hard with almost 50 buildings, but with less buildings it would be doable and would allow for amazing new baits and mind games.
   For everything below 5k, this is too much effort though. However, without any reason to build bases, we would still have the problem that people get into base building only when their attacking skills are quite advanced. So we could introduce optional daily base builds where you get loot/trophies based on the defensive performance of your base. This would also help to fix problems #2, #3, #6, and #8

## #10 Troup AI sucks
   Well, just fix it and make sure it does not break when you change something (like with the minion range/bbd ai)
